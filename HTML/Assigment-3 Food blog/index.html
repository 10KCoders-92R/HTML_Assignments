 <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1 cup roasted makhana /foxnut/lotus seed</li>
    <li>1 ½ tablespoons unsweetened peanut butter (creamy or crunchy)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ghee (or coconut oil)</li>
    <li>a pinch salt optional</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<h3>Cooking Process</h3>
<li><b>How to Roast Makhana:</b>- In a pan, add one teaspoon of ghee, 1 cup of Makhana, and roast them on very low heat for 5-6 minutes. Keep stirring them in between so that Makhana does not burn.
To check if correctly roasted, take one Makhana in hand and crush it. If it breaks nicely with a crunching sound, that means they are done perfectly. Now transfer makhanas to a plate and keep aside.</li>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
   <b>Variations</b>

<li>Use almond butter instead of peanut butter for a variation.</li>
<li>You can add 1 tablespoon of shredded or desiccated coconut to the peanut butter mixture for extra taste.</li>
<li>You can also add 1 tablespoon of sesame seeds to the peanut butter mixture.</li>
<li>If you are vegan you can replace ghee with coconut oil or olive oil.</li>
<ul>
    <b>Tips</b>
    <li>Make sure to roast makhanas before adding to peanut butter. Makhanas should be crispy.</li>
    <li>Do everything in low flame to get the perfect texture and taste.</li>
    <li>You can store it in an airtight container for a week at room temperature. If they are exposed to the air they get soggy and does-not taste well.</li>

        <hr>
    <h3>Notes</h3> 
    <li>Roast the foxnut (makhana) till they are crisp before adding to the makhana sabzi</li>
    <li>Add roasted foxnuts just a few minutes before serving the curry. This prevents the roasted Phool makhanas from turning soggy.</li>
    <li>Homemade Paneer works the best. If you have store brought paneer, then soak paneer in hot water for 15 minutes to keep them soft.</li>
    <li>Adding Kasuri methi at the end gives a restaurant-style taste to this paneer dish.</li>
    <li>I have added Kashmiri red chili powder to give nice red color to this dish. However, if you want to make it spicier add extra red chili powder.</li>
    <li>Always add the cream at the end of cooking else it will curdle.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <h3>Variations</h3>
        <li>You can also add khoya/mawa along with cream to give a rich texture and taste to make the Khoya Matar Makhana recipe.</li>
        <li>You can also skip paneer and replace it with mushrooms or aloo (baby potato) in this makhana ki sabji recipe.</li>
        <li>Adding sugar or honey balances the flavors and so you can add ½ teaspoon of sugar or 1 teaspoon of honey in the end</li>
    </ul>
