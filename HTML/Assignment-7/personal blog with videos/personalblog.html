    <h3>As we wait for the Chandrayaan-3 to soft-land on the moon today, here’s all you need to know about the mission </h3>

   <p>India’s third lunar mission, Chandrayaan-3, scripted history as Vikram lander touched down on the Moon surface on Wednesday evening. After the dust settled on Earth’s only satellite, Pragyan rover began its journey.</p>
   
   <p>The Pragyan rover, which was safely housed within the Vikram lander, has now rolled out onto the Moon's surface.</p>
   
   <p>"The Ch-3 Rover ramped down from the Lander and India took a walk on the moon," said the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), adding that more mission updates would be shared soon.</p>

    <legend><b>Artificial Intelligence: The Silent Navigator of Chandrayaan-3</b></legend>
    <p>A celestial symphony of technology and intellect is at play among the stars. What sets Chandrayaan-3 apart from its predecessors is its intricate integration with artificial intelligence (AI). As the spacecraft ventures into the lunar descent, AI takes center stage, conducting a complex symphony of sensors, cameras, and algorithms</p>

    <legend><b>What happened?</b></legend>
    <p>Chandrayaan-3 launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota Range (SDSC SHAR), India, on 14 July 2023 on a mission to demonstrate new technologies and to achieve India’s first soft landing on another celestial body.</p>

    <p>The spacecraft arrived in lunar orbit on 5 August. On 17 August, the lander module separated from the propulsion module and soon after began its descent to the surface</p>

    <p>On 23 August, after a nail-biting wait, ISRO confirmed that Chandrayaan-3’s lander had successfully touched down in the Moon’s southern polar region as planned</p>
    <p>“Congratulations ISRO on this historic landing. ESA is proud to support the Chandrayaan-3 mission. Our ground stations are a core element of ESA’s support to its international partners, and I am pleased that with this activity, we are further strengthening ESA’s relationship with ISRO and with India. I look forward to supporting further pioneering ISRO missions, such as Aditya-L1, in the future,” says Rolf Densing, Director of Operations at ESA’s <mark>ESOC mission operations centre</mark> in Darmstadt, Germany.</p>

    <legend><b>All activities on schedule: Isro shares Chandrayaan-3 mission update</b></legend>
    <p>“All activities are on schedule. All systems are normal. Lander Module payloads ILSA, RAMBHA and ChaSTE are turned ON today. Rover mobility operations have commenced. SHAPE payload on the Propulsion Module was turned ON on Sunday (sic),” Isro shared on X (formerly Twitter).</p>
    <p>Isro shared the latest update on Chandrayaan-3 mission, a day after touchdown on lunar surface.</p>

    <legend><b>What we know about India’s Chandrayaan 3 Moon landing mission</b></legend>

    <p>After India’s Chandrayaan 2 lander unfortunately failed to land on the Moon in 2019 during its final mission phase, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) undertook building a repeat mission with Chandrayaan 3. It is currently undergoing final tests and is slated for launch in mid 2023. Originally slated for launch in the first half of 2023, Chandrayaan 3 was robbed of its ride to space as ISRO prioritized two GSLV Mk IIIs for commercial OneWeb launches.</p>
    <p>To increase the chances of sticking the landing this time around, ISRO has made several upgrades to the Chandrayaan-2-like lander such as software improvements to accommodate failure, strengthened legs, a couple of new sensors for enhanced and redundant navigation-related measurements, and better power and communication systems. The host of sensors on the lander, its engine configuration and the gentle touchdown specifications are listed on ISRO’s official Chandrayaan 3 page.</p>

        <figcaption>The mission will also have a 2148-kilogram orbiter that will propel the 1752-kilogram lander to the Moon post-launch and put it into a 100-kilometer circular polar orbit. During and after landing, the orbiter will relay communications between the lander and Earth. It will also host the SHAPE Earth-observing experiment, which is a near-infrared spectro-polarimeter made to observe the full Earth disc from the Moon to get a sense of what signatures of habitable Earth-like exoplanets would look like</figcaption>
