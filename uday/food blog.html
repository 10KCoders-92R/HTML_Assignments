            <h1><b>Ingredients for Tiktok Pasta</b></h1>
            <ul>
                <li>cherry tomatoes – the sweeter the better! There are so many types of mini tomatoes these days, from strawberry to grape to on the vine to heirloom. I used one package of classic cherry tomatoes and one package of cherry tomatoes on the vine.</li>
                <li>feta – you’ll want to get a nice higher quality Greek feta since it’s the main flavor of the dish. Grab a block of feta, the kind that comes in a brine, not the crumbles. If you want a milder, creamier feta, try French feta, it’s less tart than Greek.</li>
                <li>olive oil – most of the recipes I’ve seen call from anywhere from 1/4 to 1/2 cup of olive oil. I went with 1/3 cup, you want enough to coat the tomatoes and feta while having a bit of oil pool at the bottom of your baking dish so the tomatoes are essentially doing a tomato confit type thing. Too little olive oil and your tomatoes will end up drying out.</li>
                <li>pasta – you can use any shape you like, we went with casarecce the first time and rotini the second time and both were great.</li>
                <li>garlic – a couple cloves of minced garlic are mixed in and the residual heat of the tomatoes mellows the sharpness out while still giving you a huge hit of garlicky goodness.</li>
                <li>basil – fresh basil and tomatoes are perfect pairing. Slice some up to stir in and keep some extra leaves whole to garnish with!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Cooking Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Toss: In a baking dish, toss cherry tomatoes with olive oil. Place a block of feta in the middle and drizzle some oil on top.</li>

                <li>Bake: Bake the tomatoes and feta in the oven until the tomatoes burst and the cheese is melty.</li>

                <li>Cook: While the feta is in the oven, cook the pasta.</li>

                <li>Stir: When the tomatoes and feta are done, stir in some minced garlic, some crushed red pepper flakes, and the pasta, loosening with some pasta water if needed. Finish with fresh basil.</li>

            <h3>Incredients for Beefy Burrito </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>burrito size flour tortillas – the larger your tortilla, the easier it is to fold neatly into a burrito that doesn’t burst open. If you find the XL 12 inch burrito size tortillas, grab those. If you can’t, regular burrito sized tortillas will work too.</li>
                <li>nacho cheese – gooey nacho cheese is what makes up the layer in-between the two tortillas. If you have a favorite queso recipe, you can make that, or you can buy already made queso at the store. If you’re in a real pinch and you happen to have American cheese at home, that melts down into a good approximation of the melty cheese layer.</li>
                <li>refried beans – refried beans help hold everything together inside your burrito and they add protein, deliciousness, and texture. Make your own or grab a can from the store, either way, make sure they’re warm and spreadable.</li>
                <li>ground beef – the beefy beef in our beef tacos! Lean ground beef is a good choice, you don’t want it too lean otherwise your burrito meat will be too dry. You don’t want it too fat either. We’re going to add a bit of tomato paste and just a touch of flour to the beef too, to give it that signature texture of taco bell’s seasoned beef.</li>
                 <li>taco seasoning – you can buy a packet, but it’s super easy to make your own taco seasoning if you have these spices: chili powder, ground cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne. We like making our own blend because we can control the salt content – a lot of times, the first ingredient on taco packets is salt.</li>
                 <li>sour cream – a thick layer of tangy sour cream is just the right counter point to all the savory flavors of a beefy burrito.</li>
                 <li>shredded cheddar – shredded cheddar is the last finishing touch in a beefy burrito!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Cooking process </h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook: Start off by browning the beef, making sure to break it up into very tiny pieces. If you have a potato masher, you can mash the beef up while you’re cooking it. Once the beef is ready, add flour, taco spices, tomato paste, and a bit to the pan, stirring well. Let everything simmer and thicken, then set aside.</li>

                <li>Lay out 4 tortillas and evenly divide the nacho cheese between them spreading the cheese to the edges. Top the cheesy tortillas with the remaining 4 tortillas gently pressing them together.</li>

                <li>Fill: Now it’s time to fill our double burritos! top each double tortilla with an equal amount of beans, beef, sour cream, and cheddar cheese.</li>

                <li>Wrap: Tightly, but gently wrap up the burritos (more of burrito wrapping below).</li>

                <li>Enjoy: Dig in! You can slice them in half, or just go for a crazy bite in the middle a la fake Justin Bieber style. Either way, enjoy the beefiness!</li>
